# Pluggable storage engine

The storage engine interface is defined at <code>org.apache.cassandra.engine.StorageEngine.java</code>,
under the interface, we implement the <code>org.apache.cassandra.rocksdb.RocksDBEngine</code>.

As in beta version, to enable RocksDBEngine for your keyspace, you just need to add following JVM options
when starting Cassandrda:
```
-Dcassandra.rocksdb.keyspace=<your keyspace>
-Dcassandra.rocksdb.dir=<your directory to put RocksDB data>
-Dcassandra.rocksdb.stream.dir=<your temp directory to put RocksDB streaming files>
```
Under the ```-Dcassandra.rocksdb.stream.dir```, directories will be created automatically for each RocksDB
based keyspace and columnfamily.
